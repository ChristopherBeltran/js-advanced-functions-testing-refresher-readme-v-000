# Why Test?

## Objectives

1. Explain why we write tests for our applications
2. Describe high-level approaches to testing
3. Explain the difference between unit and integration tests

## Outline

We mostly want to sell students on the "sexiness" of testing here.

Testing gets a bad rap (I think, anyway), because it's seen as
a chore or not "real" programming. But testing helps us gauge the
robustness of our code so that we can modify and improve it â€”
testing, in other words, helps our code grow.

It might be helpful to think of a science experiment. Sure, it's great
when an experiment produces the hypothesized results; but in order
for the results to be considered valid, they need to be repeatable.
With programming, we could have other people run our code and verify
that they get the same results as we do, but that's silly. Instead,
we can simply write tests.
